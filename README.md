# COVID-19_Daily_update
This dataset capture the daily COVID-19 data across the world. The data sources are from different official websites. 

Data Summary Dataset name: COVID-19 Hospital Needs and Death Projections 
Summary: 

IHME has produced forecasts which show hospital bed use, need for intensive care beds, and ventilator use due to COVID-19 based on projected deaths for the United States, at the country and subnational level, and countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Forecasts at the subnational level are included for three EEA countries: Germany, Italy, and Spain. These projections are produced by models based on observed death rates from COVID-19, and include uncertainty intervals. They incorporate information about social distancing and other protective measures and are being updated daily with new data. These forecasts were developed in order to provide hospitals, policy makers, and the public with crucial information about how expected need aligns with existing resources, so that cities and countries can best prepare.
